## Classification Prediction Problem

This is the github repository of my classification prediction problem. In this assignment, I sought to develop models that predict whether Airbnb offerings have hosts with the "super host" designation. The target variable in the datasets `host_is_superhost` is a binary factor variable with two outcomes: yes, the host is a superhost, or no, the host is not a superhost. The data for this assignment was collected from Kaggle and contains plentiful information regarding Airbnb offerings up to the year 2023. The overarching goal of this problem is to apply machine learning methods to achieve the best classification prediction possible on an unknown testing dataset, given a training dataset.

### Folders

-`data`: contains the original training and testing datasets

-`data-splitting`: contains the cleaned and prepared training dataset, testing dataset, and folds of the training dataset.

-`images`: contains images generated for the memo.

-`r_scripts`: contains R scripts used to write recipes, develop models, and generate predictions with the models.

-`recipes`: contains the saved recipes

-`results`: contains the saved results of the models developed

-`submissions`: contains the sets of predictions generated in from different models.

### Memo

Following successful submission of my predictions, I wrote memo describing my methods in generating these predictions. The qmd and html file of the memo are saved as follows.
